# CautiousRenewal
CautiousRenewal is a Minecraft texturepack for Beta 1.7.3 which aims to carefully and conservatively improve Minecraft's appearance without making it feel like you're using a texturepack, mainly by intoducing hue shifting, decreasing noise and limiting palettes. Aside from using it in a game directly, you can employ CR as a base for your own texture pack over vanilla textures. 

## How do I download it?
If you're on Github, click on green "Code" button above the file list and pick '**Download ZIP**'. Use the ZIP as you'd use regular Texture Pack.
