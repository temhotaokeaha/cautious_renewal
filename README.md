# CautiousRenewal
CautiousRenewal is a Minecraft texturepack for Beta 1.7.3 which aims to carefully and conservatively improve Minecraft's appearance without making it feel like you're using a texturepack, mainly by intoducing hue shifting, decreasing noise and limiting palettes. Aside from using it in a game directly, you can employ CR as a base for your own texture pack over vanilla textures.
